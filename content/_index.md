# queer internet scrabble cooperative  

welcome!

## abstract

we are a group of LGBTQIA+ pals (and an ally or two) who get together weekly over [isc.ro](https://isc.ro).

## join us

to join us, hit up our [discord server](https://discord.gg/BTuA7mHB).

## events

online matches + occasional in-person meet ups.

## schedule

we are in the process of holding a coop-wide poll on the best times for weekly match scheduling. broadly speaking, the current concept is to schedule a block of time during which matches will be held concurrently, and then a block of time afterwards for debrief and community catch up.
